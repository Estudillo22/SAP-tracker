# SAP-Tracker

## About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was created to obtain trajectories of synthetic active particles in 2D, which contributed to the publication of the article DOI: 'xxx.org.0012'. The main idea was to have a simple and fast tracker taking advantage of what the OpenCV library offers for image analysis.

The project consists of three modules, each with its functions to facilitate the detection and tracking of particles. These functions are adaptable based on the experimental setup's conditions. Currently, this code only considers the experimental configuration used in the article mentioned above.

## Prerequisites
